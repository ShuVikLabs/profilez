## Title: Design the API Spec and Data Model for the Biodata App

### Description:
Design the initial API specification and data model for the Biodata App. Base the data model on the MVP phase: Candidate â†’ id, slug, fullName, headline, summary, links. Prepare a clear OpenAPI/Swagger spec for the endpoints:
- POST /candidates
- PUT /candidates/{id}
- GET /candidates/{slug}
- GET /health
Document the data fields and relationships for future extensibility (such as Experience, Project, Skill, Recruiter, etc).
